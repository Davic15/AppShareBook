Create an app that helps people to share books
  - The app should easily allow users to sign up and setup a basic profile
  - Users can make books available for sharing, providing all the relevant pieces of information by accessing some shared database
  - Users can search for shared books and get in contact, via the app, with the book owner in order to arrange the withdrawal and successive return
  - As a consequence of each sharing, users' reputation must be updated
Groups are encouraged to propose extensions to these basic requirements
